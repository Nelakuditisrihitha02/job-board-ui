# Job Board UI

Nelakuditi Srihitha Track 1 – Frontend Development PRou Assessment 2025

This is a small frontend project built for the PRou Frontend Development Assessment
(Track 1 – Web Development). The task was to create a functional UI using mock JSON data.
I chose to build a simple Job Board where users can view available jobs, filter them,
and check individual job details in a modal.
