# Job Board UI

Nelakuditi Srihitha
Track 1 – Frontend Development
PRou Assessment 2025


This is a small frontend project built for the PRou Frontend Development Assessment  
(Track 1 – Web Development). The task was to create a functional UI using mock JSON data.  
I chose to build a simple Job Board where users can view available jobs, filter them,  
and check individual job details in a modal.
